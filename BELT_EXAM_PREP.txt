1 CORE REVIEW

EXAM is emulating a take home challenge
The exam is written as a real life example of a potential employer giving you a timed exercise to test your knowledge

1. take 100% of the exam time! 
ORANGE BELT = 8 hours total
RED/BLACK BELT = 5hours - 4.5 hours + 30 mins
DO NOT DROP EARLY - take breaks
👉 Ask Clarification questions

2. Don't panic!
- the only risk here is for you to find and expose a weakness to study and correct! 🙂

3. Don't watch the clock ⏳
- set alarms for mid way - last hour and last 20 mins

4. Start with what you know
- save black-belt features for the end

5. Don't start the exam until you have your environment setup and ready
- 📂 client - react client
- 📂 server - node server
(boiler plate) --> *

6. Use exam instructions as checklist and follow the yellow sticky notes
- double check before submitting***
- don't overthink features - do only what the exam asks

7. Use the platform - 100% of the RED BELT & BLACK BELT features are IN the platform.

8.🗑️🚮delete/EXCLUDE node_modules. BOTH OF THEM!
/client /node_modules
/server /node_modules
npm install

9. Don't go over time, submit anyway I will still code review it with you.
- ALWAYS submit what you have
- not submitting is automatic FAIL

10. Even if you are feeling nervous - Take the exam anyway as an assignment and finish it

12. STAY IN ZOOM THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE TIME OF THE EXAM 
- DON'T EXIT ZOOM 
- DON'T JOIN ANOTHER DISCORD SERVER 
-> VOID THE EXAM

13. Join lecture room so I can assign you to an exam room
9:00 - 10:00 MST

14. DO NOT ENTER a TA HELP CHANNEL in discord
-> VOID THE EXAM

15. Don't cheat. PERIOD
- it's very easy to catch cheaters
- code is like a fingerprint
- you need to feel comfortable about what you do and do not know to survive an engineering role
    AVAILABLE RESOURCES
    - Learn Platform
    - ONLY Our class Github + YOUR Git repo
    - Your code, your notes
    - Official documentation
    - NO A.I. tools

16. ASKING FOR HELP
 - this is an EXAM ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
	-> READ the errors
	-> what route is it not working on?
	-> what function is it in?
	-> what response is/not coming back?
 - if you are stuck on a bug for > 20 mins I may or may not POINT you to a direction
 - Ping in our main class DISCORD COHORT CHANNEL. 
 DO NOT DM OR RAISE HAND ON ZOOM
 👉 screen share BEFORE asking for help - to speed up the process!

17. GETTING GRADED

 - test all routes / features
 - MUST SUBMIT before grading
 - Ping in our class DISCORD COHORT CHANNEL
